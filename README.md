# Weather_Forecast
Real Time Weather forecasting data pipeline with weather alerts

This project implements a real-time data engineering system that ingests live weather data from free public APIs, processes and enriches the data through scalable pipelines, stores insights in a cloud database, generates short-term forecasts, and notifies users about critical weather events.

The entire project is built using free-tier cloud resources, open-source frameworks, and lightweight streaming tools
